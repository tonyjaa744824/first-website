This 18+ programme provides a broad base of professional training in ballet, contemporary dance, jazz dance and musical theatre, with in-depth development of specialist skills, educating quality performers who graduate into all areas of the performing arts.<br> <br>
The programme’s full title (depending on the pathway studied) is:<br><br>
SD.Dance Studio (Ballet)<br>
SD.Dance Studio (Contemporary Dance)<br>
SD.Dance Studio (Jazz & Commercial Dance)<br>
SD.Dance Studio (Musical Theatre)<br><br>
Performance opportunities are built into the curriculum throughout all three years, ranging from informal, in-house presentations of work to full evening performances at major London venues and elsewhere across the UK.<br><br>

Technical training and performance are combined with creative practice and choreography, as well as intellectually-challenging theory and research. Students are enabled to think critically about dance, enhancing their understanding of the industry and their development as performers and practitioners. Studies include anatomy, and the ever-changing history and culture of dance – from ballet to Beyoncé.<br><br>

LSC’s programme enables students to take increased ownership of their own training path, whilst producing dance artists who have the versatility to work in a wide range of fields. Graduates may be found performing in international dance companies, West End and Broadway shows, on film and television; also, they achieve successful and sustainable careers in choreography, directing, arts management and education.<br><br>
This programme is quality assured by Middlesex University and you will receive a Middlesex award on successful completion.</div></font>
